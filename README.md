## üë©‚Äçüíª	Overview

Our model is a RAG chatbot that takes in a user query as input and offers a response informed by a database collected from a wide range of US and EU legislations, court cases, and policy-related scholarly articles. The chatbot is built in Python, using LangChain for developing LLM pipelines, OpenAI's GPT-4o, OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small, and Choma vector database.

On startup, the chatbot will load the vector database (persisted on disk) and ask for the user to enter a query.

When a query is input, the chatbot will retrieve context, augment the user's original query, and feed the combined prompt into GPT-4o through LangChain, outputting a response.
